# Setting up MongoDB

npm install mongoose

-------

After installing the node package, you'll have to go to the [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) website, create an account and follow the steps to create a database from there.

Add a new line to your .env file, call it `DB_URI`
Your .env should look like this afterwards

```
TOKEN=Your Discord Bot's Token
CLIENT_ID=Your Discord Bot's Client ID
GUILD_ID=Your Server's ID
PUBLICKEY=Your Discord Bot's Public Key
DB_URI=Your provided database URI
```

Follow the examples from there.
